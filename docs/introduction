# Introduction

Emulation has long been a way for enthusiasts to relive gaming experiences from the past, allowing classic games to be played on modern hardware without outdated consoles. This project aims to create a robust emulation machine capable of running games from a variety of consoles, including the GameCube, Wii, and PlayStation 3 any many more.

As a lifelong gamer and tech enthusiast, Iâ€™m fascinated by the blend of hardware and software. This project combines both interests by creating a powerful gaming platform that showcases hardware, software, and peripherals, aiming for the best experience for each console's emulation.

This documentation will record my process, from planning and design through execution, highlighting decisions made and challenges encountered.
